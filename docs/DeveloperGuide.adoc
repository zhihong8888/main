By: `CS2113-T16-4`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book, Schedule List, Expenses List and Recruitment List data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`, `ObservableList<Schedule>`, `ObservableList<Expenses>` and `ObservableList<Recruitment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the Expenses List data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the Schedule List data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the Recruitment List data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedModelList`, which oversees all the undo and redo for other
storage, namely, `VersionedAddressBook`, `VersionedScheduleList`, `VersionedExpensesList`
and `VersionedRecruitmentList`.

`VersionedModelList` stored internally as an `modelTypesStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#add()` -- Save the storage model type that has committed in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#addMultiple()` -- Saves the set of storage model types that has committed in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Delegate `VersionedAddressBook`, `VersionedScheduleList`, `VersionedExpensesList`
and `VersionedRecruitmentList` to restore the previous storage model state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` --  Delegate `VersionedAddressBook`, `VersionedScheduleList`, `VersionedExpensesList`
and `VersionedRecruitmentList` to restore a previously undone address book state from its history.

The following is an example of `VersionedAddressBook` implementation. The implementation will
be similar to `VersionedScheduleList`, `VersionedExpensesList` and `VersionedRecruitmentList`.

`VersionedAddressBook` extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::modifyPay[]
=== Modify Pay Feature
The command `modifyPay` allows the user to modify the salary and bonus of the employee based on the input.

==== Current Implementation

The implementation of this command consist of two phases.

===== Phase 1

The `modifyPay` function is first supported by `ModifyPayCommandParser` which implements the `Parser` interface. The interface parse the arguments parameter, which was inputted by the users to form the `ModifyPayCommand` object. The arguments will also have their validity checked by the method, `isValidSalary` and `isValidBonus`, within respective Classes before being parse into the salary and bonus column which will return an error message when the arguments did not meet the requirements.

Code Snippet of `ModifyPayCommandParser` that show the parsing of input and the checking validity of the inputs:

[source, java]
----
    public class ModifyPayCommandParser implements Parser<ModifyPayCommand> {
        private static final double BONUS_UPPER_LIMIT = 24.0;

        public ModifyPayCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
            requireNonNull(args);

            ArgumentMultimap argMultimap = ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_SALARY, PREFIX_BONUS);

            Index index;

            try {
                index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(argMultimap.getPreamble());
            } catch (ParseException pe) {
                throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, ModifyPayCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE), pe);
            }

            if (!didPrefixAppearOnlyOnce(args)) {
                throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, ModifyPayCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
            }

            ModSalaryDescriptor modSalaryDescriptor = new ModSalaryDescriptor();

            if (argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_SALARY).isPresent()) {
                modSalaryDescriptor.setSalary(ParserUtil.parseSalary(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_SALARY).get()));
            }

            if (argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_BONUS).isPresent()) {
                Bonus bonusInput = ParserUtil.parseBonus(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_BONUS).get());

                double bonus = Double.parseDouble(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_BONUS).get());

                if (bonus > BONUS_UPPER_LIMIT) {
                    throw new ParseException(Bonus.MESSAGE_BONUS_CONSTRAINTS);
                }

                modSalaryDescriptor.setBonus(bonusInput);
            }

            if (!modSalaryDescriptor.isAnyFieldEdited()) {
                throw new ParseException(ModifyPayCommand.MESSAGE_NOT_MODIFIED);
            }

            return new ModifyPayCommand(index, modSalaryDescriptor);
        }
        private boolean didPrefixAppearOnlyOnce(String argument) {
            String salaryPrefix = " " + PREFIX_SALARY.toString();
            String bonusPrefix = " " + PREFIX_BONUS.toString();

            return argument.indexOf(salaryPrefix) == argument.lastIndexOf(salaryPrefix)
                    && argument.indexOf(bonusPrefix) == argument.lastIndexOf(bonusPrefix);
        }
    }

Code snippet of `Salary`

[source, java]
----
    public static final String MESSAGE_SALARY_CONSTRAINTS =
            "Salary should only contain numbers, and it should not be blank. Only a maximum of 6 whole numbers and "
            + "2 decimal place are allowed. (Max Salary store value is 999999.99)\n";
    public static final String SALARY_VALIDATION_REGEX = "[%]?[-]?[0-9]{1,6}([.][0-9]{1,2})?";
    public final String value;

    /**
     * Constructs a {@code salary}.
     *
     * @param salary A valid salary.
     */

    public Salary(String salary) {
        requireNonNull(salary);
        checkArgument(isValidSalary(salary), MESSAGE_SALARY_CONSTRAINTS);
        value = salary;
    }

    /**
     * Returns true if a given string is a valid salary.
     */
    public static boolean isValidSalary(String test) {
        return test.matches(SALARY_VALIDATION_REGEX);
    }
----

Code snippet of `Bonus`

[source, java]
----
    public static final String MESSAGE_BONUS_CONSTRAINTS =
            "Bonus should only contain positive numbers and maximum of 2 decimal places from 0 to 24,"
            + " and it should not be blank";
    public static final String BONUS_VALIDATION_REGEX = "(([0-9]{1,7}([.][0-9]{1,2})?)|(1[0-9]{7}([.][0-9]{1,2})?)"
            + "|(2[0-3]([0-9]{1,6})([.][0-9]{1,2})?))";
    public final String value;

    public Bonus(String bonus) {
        requireNonNull(bonus);
        checkArgument(isValidBonus(bonus), MESSAGE_BONUS_CONSTRAINTS);
        value = bonus;
    }

    /**
     * Returns true if a given string is a valid bonus.
     */
    public static boolean isValidBonus(String test) {
        return test.matches(BONUS_VALIDATION_REGEX);
    }
----

===== Phase 2

The `ModifyPayCommand` is being executed in this phase. `createModifiedPerson` method calls for the edited value from `ModifyPayCommandParser` to check if there are values being inputted by the users. When it is found to be a null values, `createModifiedPerson` will take back the original value.

Code snippet of `ModifyPayCommand` which execute the `createModifiedPerson` method:

[source, java]
----
    private static Person createModifiedPerson(Person personToEdit,
                   ModSalaryDescriptor modSalaryDescriptor) throws ParseException {
        assert personToEdit != null;

        EmployeeId updatedEmployeeId = personToEdit.getEmployeeId();
        Name updatedName = personToEdit.getName();
        DateOfBirth updatedDateOfBirth = personToEdit.getDateOfBirth();
        Phone updatedPhone = personToEdit.getPhone();
        Email updatedEmail = personToEdit.getEmail();
        Department updatedDepartment = personToEdit.getDepartment();
        Position updatedPosition = personToEdit.getPosition();
        Address updatedAddress = personToEdit.getAddress();
        Salary updatedSalary = ParserUtil.parseSalary(typeOfSalaryMod(personToEdit, modSalaryDescriptor));
        Bonus updatedBonus = ParserUtil.parseBonus(modifyBonusMonth(personToEdit, modSalaryDescriptor, updatedSalary));

        Set<Tag> updatedTags = personToEdit.getTags();

        return new Person(updatedEmployeeId, updatedName, updatedDateOfBirth, updatedPhone, updatedEmail,
                updatedDepartment, updatedPosition, updatedAddress, updatedSalary, updatedBonus, updatedTags);
    }
----

The result of `ModifyPayCommand` is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is
passed back into the UI to reflect the newly modified Salary/Bonus.
The sequence diagram below illustrates the operation of `modifyPay` command:

image::ModifyPayCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="850"]

==== Employee's Pay Report: `payReport` _[Upcoming in 2.0]_
Generate a report to show the break down of employee's pay such as base Salary, Bonus, Overtime Pay and CPF Contribution. [Upcoming in 2.0]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect implementation of `modifyPay` command:

* Alternative 1(current choice): A separate command to handle modification of payroll.

** Pros: Reduce the risk of accidental editing of sensitive information
** Cons: Additional method and prefixes are required to execute the function

* Alternative 2: One command to handle all the modifications
** Pros: Lesser Class to handle different fields
** Cons: User may accidentally touched on sensitive data and ended up editing them

// end::modifyPay[]

// tag::RecruitmentPost[]
=== Recruitment Post Feature
`Recruitment post` features allows HR staffs to manage internal recruitment posts easily before publishing to the public
. It allows users to do add, delete, clear, select and edit recruitment post based on 3 fields including job position,
working experience, and job description.

All logic commands come with a dedicated parser. These parsers ensure that the input conforms to the following
field restrictions in phase 1 before parsing to the actual command for execution in phase 2:
[width="90%",cols="25%,<15%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Field Name |Prefix |Limitations

|JOB_POSITION |jp/ | Job position accepts only characters. It must not be blank and should not include numbers and
punctuation mark. And users are not allowed to exceed the character limit which is from 1 to 20
|MINIMAL_YEARS_OF_WORKING_EXPERIENCE |me/ | Minimal years of working experience must be integers and should not be blank
. And It is limited from 0 to 30
|JOB_DESCRIPTION |jd/ | Job description accepts only characters and Punctuation mark including only comma, full stop,
and single right quote. It must not be blank and should not include numbers. And users are not allowed to exceed the
character limit which is from 1 to 200
|=======================================================================

==== Current Implementation for `addRecruitmentPost`
`addRecruitmentPost` command allows a new recruitment post to be added. The sequence diagram below illustrates the
operation of `addRecruitmentPost` command:

image::Recruitment/addRecruitmentPost.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Invalid command format is used.
.. A duplicated recruitment field exists. Minimal 1 field should be different.
.. Fields' restrictions are not followed.

==== Current Implementation for `editRecruitmentPost`
`editRecruitmentPost` command allows an existing recruitment post to be edited. The sequence diagram below illustrates
the operation of `editRecruitmentPost` command:

image::Recruitment/editRecruitmentPost.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Invalid command format is used.
.. A duplicated recruitment field exists. Minimal 1 field should be different from existing recruitment post that is
about to be edited.
.. Fields' restrictions are not followed.

==== Current Implementation for `selectRecruitmentPost`
`selectRecruitmentPost` command allows users to select an existing recruitment post based on recruit post index number
displayed in the recruitment post list panel. The sequence diagram below illustrates the operation
of `selectRecruitmentPost` command:

image::Recruitment/selectRecruitmentPost.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Invalid command format is used.
.. Recruitment post list is empty.
.. Invalid index number is used.

==== Current Implementation for `deleteRecruitmentPost`
`deleteRecruitmentPost` command allows users to delete an existing recruitment post based on recruit post index number
displayed in the recruitment post list panel. The sequence diagram below illustrates the operation
of `deleteRecruitmentPost` command:

image::Recruitment/deleteRecruitmentPost.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Invalid command format is used.
.. Recruitment post list is empty.

`publishRecruitmentPost` command allows users to publish an existing recruitment post to job portal such as job street
website. _[Upcoming in 2.0]_

==== Design Considerations for Recruitment Post Feature
Aspect implementation of all Recruitment Post Commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have separate commands
to manage recruitment posts.
** Pros: Individual command is easier for user to use and easier for developer to debug and test.
** Cons: More methods and implementation is required.
* **Alternative 2:** Have a single command to manage recruitment posts.
** Pros: Lesser methods and implementation is required.
** Cons: The command could be too complicated for users to use as more fields would be needed.

=== Schedule Feature

`Schedule` command helps the HR admins to schedule employee's work and leave schedules in the company.
A person can have multiple schedules. Type field describes whether the schedule is a work or a leave.
Below is the schedule class diagram.

image::Schedule/schedule_class.png[width="400"]

For each schedule commands, it comes with a dedicated schedule parser.
First, the schedule parsers ensure that the prefix required are all present with `!arePrefixesPresent`.
[source, java]
----
    ...
    private static boolean arePrefixesPresent(ArgumentMultimap argumentMultimap, Prefix... prefixes) {
        return Stream.of(prefixes).allMatch(prefix -> argumentMultimap.getValue(prefix).isPresent());
    }
    ...
----
The parsers validate field inputs by creating a new `Type`, `Date`, `EmployeeId` and `Schedule` object.

[source, java]
----
        ...
        Type type = ParserUtil.parseStatus(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_SCHEDULE_TYPE).get());
        Date date = ParserUtil.parseDate(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_SCHEDULE_DATE).get());
        EmployeeId id = ParserUtil.parseEmployeeId(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_EMPLOYEEID).get());
        Schedule schedule = new Schedule(id, type, date);
        ...
----

The objects will `throw exception` if it does not conform to the following field restrictions.

[width="90%",cols="25%,<15%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Field Name
|Prefix
|Limitations

|EMPLOYEEID
|id/
|Employee Id should only contain exactly 6 numbers.

|DATE
|d/
|Date must be a valid date in the calendar DD/MM/YYYY]. Year must also fall into the range
 of 2000-2099. Leading 0s can be omitted in day and month field.
 You are not allowed to schedule for dates that have past today's date.

|TYPE
|t/
|Type can be either WORK or LEAVE only, case not sensitive.

|=======================================================================


==== Add Schedule
`addSchedule` command allows a new work or leave schedule to be added.
Shown below is the normal flow of the sequence diagram for adding a new schedule.

image::Schedule/addSchedule_seq.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Employee Id of the schedule to be added is not found in address book.
.. A duplicated schedule exists.
.. User wants to add a work schedule, but a leave schedule exists on same date.
.. User wants to add leave schedule, but a work schedule exists on same date.

The `AddScheduleParser` parses a `Schedule` object to the `AddWorks` command.
`AddWorks` command looks at the `Type` inside the `Schedule`.

[source, java]
----
Type type = toAddSchedule.getType();
----

If the `Type` is equals to leave and work is not scheduled on the same date `model.hasSchedule(toCheckWork)`,
no exception will be thrown.

[source, java]
----
...
if (type.equals(leave)) {
    Schedule toCheckWork = new Schedule(toAddSchedule.getEmployeeId(), work,
        toAddSchedule.getScheduleDate());
    if (model.hasSchedule(toCheckWork)) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_HAS_WORK);
}
...
----
And it adds the schedule and commit to the storage.
[source, java]
----
...
model.addSchedule(toAddSchedule);
model.commitScheduleList();
...
----
==== Delete Schedule
`deleteSchedule` command allows a schedule to be deleted.
Shown below is the normal flow of the sequence diagram for adding a new schedule.

image::Schedule/deleteSchedule_seq.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Index parsed is an invalid index in the ScheduleList panel.

==== Add Works
`addWorks` command allows multiple work schedules to be added based on
the employees shown in the employee's panel.
Shown below is the normal flow of the sequence diagram for adding a working schedule.

image::Schedule/addWorks_seq.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Size of the filtered person list is 0. This happens when there are no
employees shown.
.. Commit is false. This happens either when all employees have been
added work, or some had leave on the same day.

The `AddWorksParser` parses a set of dates `Set<Date>` to be scheduled work to the `AddWorks` command.
For each date specified by the user in the set of dates `for (Date date :setOfDates)`,
it will be checked by for each observable employee in the employee list `for (Person person : model.getFilteredPersonList())`
for the possibility of scheduling work.
No schedules will be created if a duplicate schedule `model.hasSchedule(toAddSchedule)`
or existing work schedule `model.hasSchedule(hasLeaveSchedule)` is found on that date.

[source, java]
----
...
for (Date date :setOfDates) {
    for (Person person : model.getFilteredPersonList()) {
        Schedule toAddSchedule = new Schedule(person.getEmployeeId(), work , date);
        Schedule hasLeaveSchedule = new Schedule(person.getEmployeeId(), leave , date);
        if (model.hasSchedule(hasLeaveSchedule)) {
            employeeIdMapToLeaves.put(person.getEmployeeId(), date);
        } else if (!model.hasSchedule(toAddSchedule)) {
            commit = true;
            model.addSchedule(toAddSchedule);
        }
    }
}
...
----

==== Delete Works
`deleteWorks` command allows multiple work schedules to be deleted based on
the employees shown in the employee's panel.
Shown below is the normal flow of the sequence diagram for deleting multiple work schedules.

image::Schedule/deleteWorks_seq.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Size of the filtered person list is 0. This happens when there are no
employees shown.

The `deleteWorksParser` parses a set of dates `Set<Date>` to be deleted work to the `DeleteWorks` command.

For each date specified by the user in the set of dates `for (Date date :setOfDates)`,
it will be checked by for each observable employee in the employee list `for (Person person : model.getFilteredPersonList())`
for the possibility of deleting work. Work schedule will be deleted `model.deleteSchedule(toDeleteSchedule)`
if found on that date `model.hasSchedule(toDeleteSchedule)`.

[source, java]
----
...
for (Date date : setOfDates) {
    for (Person person : model.getFilteredPersonList()) {
        Schedule toDeleteSchedule = new Schedule(person.getEmployeeId(), work , date);
        if (model.hasSchedule(toDeleteSchedule)) {
            commit = true;
            model.deleteSchedule(toDeleteSchedule);
        }
    }
}
...
----

// end::schedule1[]

==== Add Leaves
`addLeaves` command allows multiple leave schedules to be added based on
the employees shown in the employee's panel.
Shown below is the normal flow of the sequence diagram for adding a leave schedule.

image::Schedule/addLeaves_seq.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Size of the filtered person list is 0. This happens when there are no
employees shown.
.. Commit is false. This happens either when all employees have been
added work, or some had leave on the same day.

==== Delete Leaves
`deleteLeaves` command allows multiple leave schedules to be deleted based on
the employees shown in the employee's panel.
Shown below is the normal flow of the sequence diagram for deleting multiple leave schedules.

image::Schedule/deleteLeaves_seq.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Size of the filtered person list is 0. This happens when there is no
employees shown.

// tag::schedule2[]

==== Calculate Leaves
`calculateLeaves` command allows user to calculate leaves taken for the specified employee id and year.
Shown below is the normal flow of the sequence diagram for calculating leaves.

image::Schedule/calculateLeaves_seq.png[width="650"]

In addition, Command Exception will be thrown due to the following:

.. Employee Id to be calculated is not found in address book.
.. Employee Id has not taken any leaves in the specified year.

The `CalculateLeavesCommandParser` parses a `EmployeeId` and `Year` object
to the `CalculateLeaves` command.
`CalculateLeaves` filters the schedule list to show only schedules that
contains the `employeeId` to be calculated.

[source, java]
----
List<String> employeeIdList = new ArrayList<>();
employeeIdList.add(employeeId.value);
EmployeeIdScheduleContainsKeywordsPredicate employeeIdPredicate =
        new EmployeeIdScheduleContainsKeywordsPredicate(employeeIdList);
model.updateFilteredScheduleList(employeeIdPredicate);
----

For each schedule in the filtered schedule list `for (Schedule schedule : model.getFilteredScheduleList()`
if the leave and year matches the one to be calculated, it
increments the number of leaves `numLeaves`.

[source, java]
----
...
for (Schedule schedule : model.getFilteredScheduleList()) {
    if (schedule.getScheduleYear().equals(year.toString())
            && schedule.getType().toString().equals(Type.LEAVE)) {
        numLeaves++;
    }
}
...
----

Finally it returns the calculated leave.

[source, java]
----
CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, employeeId, year, numLeaves))
----

==== Send Schedule: `sendSchedule` _[Upcoming in 2.0]_

Send schedules to the employee for calendar import using the Employee's email address. _[Upcoming in 2.0]_

==== Design considerations for Schedule Features
Aspect: Command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have separate commands
to add work/leave schedules.
** Pros: Easier for the user to use, without the need to specify
the type of schedule.
** Cons: More codes needed, but easier for user to schedule
for multiple employees with multiple dates.
* **Alternative 2:** Have a single command to add work/leave schedule.
** Pros: Easier to code.
** Cons: Requires user to specify type of schedule. Can only
schedule 1 at a time.

Aspect: Storage

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have schedules stored in a separate
XML file.
** Pros: Easier to manage scalability issues as schedules grow in numbers.
Possibility of having a database for schedule in future.
** Cons: More codes needed. Extra time is needed to delete schedules when
employee is deleted.
* **Alternative 2:** Have schedules stored in the same XML file as addressbook.xml
** Pros: Pros: Easier to implement, as only an additional field is required by modeling it as a set of schedules.
** Cons: Very hard to manage large number of schedules, or add additional
fields to describe the schedule.

// end::schedule2[]

// tag::Expenses[]
=== Expenses Feature
The expenses feature contains to two commands.

* The command `addex` allows the user to add expenses for each employee.
* The command `removeex` allows the user to remove expenses for each employee.

==== Current Implementation for `addex` command
The `addex` mechanism is facilitated by `AddExpensesCommandParser`.
The `AddExpensesCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface, parses the arguments parameter, which is the input from the user, and creates a new `AddExpensesCommand` object.
Checks on whether the input complies with the required format is handled by other classes.
This checking of input compliance is facilitated by two helper methods, namely `isValidEmployeeId` from `EmployeeId` class and `isValidExpensesAmount` from `ExpensesAmount` class.

[NOTE]
If the input does not comply with the required format, an error message will be shown to the user.

Code snippet of `isValidEmployeeId` that shows the checking of the input compliance:

[source, java]
----
public static final String EMPLOYE_EXPENSES_ID_VALIDATION_REGEX = "\\d{3,}";

/**
     * Returns true if a given string is a valid Employee Expenses Id.
     */
    public static boolean isValidEmployeeId(String test) {
        return test.matches(EMPLOYE_EXPENSES_ID_VALIDATION_REGEX);
    }
----

Code snippet of `isValidExpensesAmount` that shows the checking of the input compliance:

[source, java]
----
public static final String EMPLOYE_EXPENSES_AMOUNT_VALIDATION_REGEX = "\\d{1,}";

/**
     * Returns true if a given string is a valid Expenses Amount.
     */
    public static boolean isValidExpensesAmount(String test) {
        return test.matches(EMPLOYE_EXPENSES_AMOUNT_VALIDATION_REGEX);
    }
----

==== Current Implementation for `removeex` command

The `removeex` mechanism is facilitated by `RemoveExpensesCommandParser`.
The `RemoveExpensesCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface, parses the arguments parameter, which is the input from the user, and creates a new `RemoveExpensesCommand` object.
Only Index will be required as input.
Removing of expenses is to delete selected expenses from the list based on the input Index.
Checking of whether Index is within list is facilitated by a method, `CommandResult` of the `RemoveExpensesCommand` class.
The `CommandResult` method also calls the `deleteExpenses` method and `commitExpenses` method from `model` interface to delete the expenses and commit the changes into the xml storage.

[NOTE]
If the input Index isn't found in the list, an error message will be shown to the user.

Code snippet of `CommandResult` from `RemoveExpensesCommand` class that checks the input Index and calling the `deleteExpenses` method and `commitExpenses` to delete the expenses and commit the changes:

[source, java]
----
@Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        List<Expenses> lastShownList = model.getFilteredExpensesList();

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_EXPENSES_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        Expenses expensesToRemove = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
        model.deleteExpenses(expensesToRemove);
        model.commitExpensesList();
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_REMOVE_EXPENSES_SUCCESS, expensesToRemove));
    }
----

// end::Expenses[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter Feature
The command `filter` allows the user to filter employees based on their respective department and/or position within the company.

==== Current Implementation
The implementation of this command is separated into two phases.

===== Phase 1
The `filter` command's mechanism is facilitated by `FilterCommandParser`.
The `FilterCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface, parses the arguments parameter, which is the input from the user, and creates a new `FilterCommand` object.
Apart from parsing the input, the `FilterCommandParser` also checks whether the input complies with the required format.
The checking of input compliance is assisted by a helper method, `didPrefixesAppearOnlyOnce`, which checks whether the department prefix and/or position prefix appears only once.

[NOTE]
If the input does not comply with the required format, an error message will be shown to the user.

Code snippet of the `parse` method within `FilterCommandParser` showing the checks for input compliance:
[source, java]
----
public FilterCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    ...
    ...

    ArgumentMultimap argMultimap = ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_DEPARTMENT, PREFIX_POSITION);

    if (trimmedArgs.isEmpty() || (!argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_DEPARTMENT).isPresent()
            && !argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_POSITION).isPresent()) || !didPrefixesAppearOnlyOnce(trimmedArgs)
            || !ACCEPTED_ORDERS.contains(sortOrder)) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, FilterCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }

    ...
    ...
}
----

Code snippet of the helper method `didPrefixesAppearOnlyOnce`:
[source, java]
----
public boolean didPrefixesAppearOnlyOnce(String argument) {
    String departmentPrefix = " " + PREFIX_DEPARTMENT.toString();
    String positionPrefix = " " + PREFIX_POSITION.toString();

    return argument.indexOf(departmentPrefix) == argument.lastIndexOf(departmentPrefix)
            && argument.indexOf(positionPrefix) == argument.lastIndexOf(positionPrefix);
}
----

If the input complies with the required format, further checks will be performed on the keywords to ensure that the keywords are valid.
This keywords checking is completed by the `processDepartmentKeywords` and `processPositionKeywords` methods that are both within the `FilterCommandParser` class.
This guide will focus on explaining how `processDepartmentKeywords` work instead of both as the methods `processDepartmentKeywords` and `processPositionKeywords` are similar.

Code snippet of the `parse` method in `FilterCommandParser` calling `processDepartmentKeywords` method:

[source, java]
----
public FilterCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    ...
    ...

    if (!argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_DEPARTMENT).isPresent()) {
        filterCommand.setIsDepartmentPrefixPresent(false);
    } else if (argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_DEPARTMENT).isPresent()
            && !processDepartmentKeywords(argMultimap, filterCommand)) {
        throw new ParseException(Department.MESSAGE_DEPARTMENT_KEYWORD_CONSTRAINTS);
    }

    ...
    ...
}
----

Code snippet of `processDepartmentKeywords` helper method:

[source, java]
----
public boolean processDepartmentKeywords(ArgumentMultimap argMultimap, FilterCommand command) {
    String trimmedDepartment = (argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_DEPARTMENT).get().trim());
    String[] departmentKeywords = trimmedDepartment.split("\\s+");

    return validityCheckForDepartments(command, departmentKeywords);
}
----

The `processDepartmentKeywords` is further assisted by the `validityCheckForDepartments` method which calls another method `areDepartmentKeywordsValid` to check whether the given keywords comply with the `DEPARTMENT_KEYWORD_VALIDATION_REGEX`.
If the keywords from the user are all valid, the departmentPredicate will be created and passed to the `FilterCommand` object through a setter.

[NOTE]
The `DEPARTMENT_KEYWORD_VALIDATION_REGEX` is a regular expression that accepts only spaces and case-insensitive alphabets.
It only allows 1 to 30 characters per keyword.

Code snippet of `validityCheckForDepartments` and `areDepartmentKeywordsValid` methods in `FilterCommandParser` class:

[source, java]
----
public boolean validityCheckForDepartments(FilterCommand command, String[] keywords) {
    if (!areDepartmentKeywordsValid(keywords)) {
        return false;
    }

    command.setIsDepartmentPrefixPresent(true);
    command.setDepartmentPredicate(new DepartmentContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(keywords)));
    return true;
}

public boolean areDepartmentKeywordsValid(String[] keywords) {
    for (String keyword: keywords) {
        if (!keyword.matches(DEPARTMENT_KEYWORD_VALIDATION_REGEX)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
----

===== Phase 2
The `FilterCommand` is being executed in this phase.
`FilterCommand` first checks which prefix(es) is(are) present prior to calling the `updateFilteredPersonList` method, which updates `filteredPersonList`
 with the employees of the relevant department(s) and/or position(s) that matches the keyword(s) input from the user.
 Additionally, the methods `updateFilteredExpensesList` and `updateFilteredScheduleList` will also be called to update the `filteredExpensesList` and `filteredScheduleList` respectively to show only the matched employees' expenses and schedules.

[NOTE]
If the keywords input from the user results in 0 person found. The CLI will show the user a list of currently available department(s) and/or position(s) in the PersonList.
The listing of available department(s) and/or position(s) depends on the presence of the prefix. +
Example: If `filter asc d/hello` results in 0 person found, the CLI will list all the currently available department(s) in CHRS.

Code snippet of `FilterCommand` that checks which prefix is present prior to updating `filteredPersonList`, `filteredExpensesList` and `filteredScheduleList`:

[source, java]
----
public class FilterCommand extends Command {
    ...
    ...

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) {
        requireNonNull(model);
        String allAvailableDepartments = listAvailableDepartments(model);
        String allAvailablePositions = listAvailablePositions(model);

        if (isDepartmentPrefixPresent && !isPositionPrefixPresent) {
            model.updateFilteredPersonList(departmentPredicate, sortOrder);
        } else if (isPositionPrefixPresent && !isDepartmentPrefixPresent) {
            model.updateFilteredPersonList(positionPredicate, sortOrder);
        } else if (isDepartmentPrefixPresent && isPositionPrefixPresent) {
            model.updateFilteredPersonList(departmentPredicate.and(positionPredicate), sortOrder);
        }

        EmployeeIdExpensesContainsKeywordsPredicate expensesPredicate = generateEmployeeIdExpensesPredicate(model);
        EmployeeIdScheduleContainsKeywordsPredicate schedulePredicate = generateEmployeeIdSchedulePredicate(model);
        model.updateFilteredExpensesList(expensesPredicate);
        model.updateFilteredScheduleList(schedulePredicate);

        return new CommandResult(feedbackToUser(model, allAvailableDepartments, allAvailablePositions));
    }

    ...
    ...
}
----

The result of the execution of `FilterCommand` is then encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned to the `LogicManager`.
During the execution of `FilterCommand`, the `filteredPersonList`, `filteredExpensesList` and `filteredScheduleList` will be updated accordingly to display only employees, that belongs to the department(s)
 and/or hold the specified position(s) as specified by the user input.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the operation of `filter` command:

image::filterCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: Implementation of `filter` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: One command to handle filtering by department(s) and/or position(s)
** Pros: Does not require several command and parser files to handle filtering of different fields
** Cons: Additional methods required to check for presence of prefix and input validity
* **Alternative 2**: Separate commands for filtering department and position, one for department and one for position
** Pros: Easy to implement as it follows the existing `find` command
** Cons: More commands to create and implementation can get quite complicated when filter requires both fields

==== Future improvements: Keyword suggestion and auto complete feature _[Upcoming in 2.0]_
This feature will suggest keywords when filtering or finding employee and the keyword will be auto-completed by pressing `TAB` key. _[Upcoming in 2.0]_

// end::filter[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
